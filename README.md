# ElisaLompakko
Quick and dirty script for creating a CSV file from Aktia Wallet (formerly Elisa Lompakko) HTML account statement. 

Usage:
 - Use Python 3.5 (or maybe other 3.x versions work as well)
 - Extract the HTML from the account statement (in order to get the full list, you need to use the Print 
 function and then for example Chrome developer tools to extract the HTML code). 
 - Run the script, pass the path to the html output as argument
